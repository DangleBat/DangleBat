Welcome to *The DangleBat Chronicles*, a unique creative platform designed to foster talent, trigger thought, and inspire change. We are an international charity devoted to supporting artists from developing nations, particularly those who have been subjected to personal hardship. We are dedicated to providing a platform for these artists to explore their creativity, share their experiences, and spark conversation about societal challenges through their work.

Our project operates on a 'Chronicles' model, crafting a universe of individual stories spanning multiple decades. These chronicles interweave themes of social, political, and economic challenges, mental health issues, and the enduring human spirit. Our stories are grounded in reality, each one drawing inspiration from true events and carrying strong political overtones. We aim to provoke thought, disturb complacency, and inspire action by highlighting the stark realities of modern society through an engaging narrative form.

Our artists are encouraged to create with as much freedom as possible, with minimal oversight. We are in the unique position of not being driven by commercial success or popularity, allowing us to push boundaries and explore taboo subjects, often flouting conventional rules of storytelling.

We focus on fostering a relaxed work environment, ensuring that no artist works more than four hours a day unless they genuinely wish to do so. This philosophy reflects our belief that in an era of advanced tools and automation, society has evolved past the need for long, exhausting workdays.

Central to our project is the use of distributed and decentralized technologies. All transactions, including payments and donations, are handled exclusively in [Bitcoin](/bitcoin/), ensuring transparency through a **[public, auditable ledger](/bitcoin/ledger.txt)**. Our digital content is distributed via [IPFS](/ipfs/), eschewing mainstream cloud services and corporate social media.

Our narrative universe is inhabited by anthropomorphic characters representing actual Earth species, with bats taking center stage as our protagonists. Mirroring systemic prejudices observed in our world, our bat characters are misunderstood and hated, not because they are inherently evil, but because societal conformity has dictated it so. This narrative thread serves as a metaphor for the vicious cycle of systemic hatred and prejudice that marginalizes sections of our society.

Through this "Art & Stories" project, we aim to shed light on the real-world struggles that these characters face, hoping to challenge readers' perspectives, provoke empathy, and inspire change. Our mission is to use the power of storytelling to address societal problems, focusing on mental health and the dangerous feedback loop of ignorance and blame.

Our project is an audacious venture to create a new narrative, challenge the status quo, and push for a more empathetic, understanding society. By leveraging the power of art and storytelling, we hope to inspire our audience to contemplate the struggles, hopes, and dreams of those often forgotten or sidelined. We welcome you to join us on this journey and look forward to sharing our stories with you.
