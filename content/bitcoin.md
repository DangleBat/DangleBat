At *The DangleBat Chronicles*, we consciously seek to align our practices with our core values of freedom, transparency, and equity. We understand the importance of financial autonomy and the need to circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of finance, such as PayPal, Patreon, Visa, or MasterCard.

Upon careful review, we have concluded that the fee structures and gatekeeping mechanisms of these services are not aligned with our ethical guidelines. We believe their practices can be seen as restrictive and excessive, and we would be remiss to support this system by participating in it.

Instead, we turn towards the revolutionary world of cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin. By utilizing Bitcoin, we align ourselves with a decentralized and borderless financial network, free from the constraints and fees imposed by traditional financial institutions.

Bitcoin allows us to uphold our commitment to transparency. All transactions, payments, and donations made to *The DangleBat Chronicles* are traceable through a public, auditable ledger. This means you can trust that your contributions are being allocated as intended, fostering creativity, empowering artists, and pushing the boundaries of storytelling.

By embracing Bitcoin, we not only secure financial freedom for our project but also take a bold step into the future, joining an innovative technological landscape that aligns with our vision.

We invite you to explore our complete **[Transaction Ledger](/bitcoin/ledger.txt)**, which remains openly accessible as a testament to our commitment to transparency and accountability. Together, let's revolutionize art, storytelling, and the way we perceive finance.
