*The DangleBat Chronicles* is an international art and storytelling charity.

Our unique endeavor focuses on providing meaningful employment to artists from developing nations while producing a richly interconnected universe of stories that tackle complex societal issues. We generate thought-provoking narratives designed to challenge preconceptions, stimulate discussions, and inspire change.

To sustain our mission, we rely on the generosity of individuals like you. We are currently seeking donations to continue supporting our artists and provide them with the resources they need to produce high-quality work that forms the backbone of our project. Your contribution will directly fund their livelihoods, enabling them to work in a relaxed environment that nurtures creativity.

We operate on a principle of transparency, utilizing [Bitcoin](/bitcoin/) for all transactions, with a **[publicly available ledger](/bitcoin/ledger.txt)**, ensuring that all funds are traceable and accounted for. This guarantees that every donation goes directly towards supporting our artists and maintaining the project's infrastructure.

As a token of our appreciation, we offer lifetime membership to every donor, irrespective of the donation amount. This membership symbolizes your invaluable contribution to our project and our shared commitment to supporting struggling artists and facilitating meaningful societal discussions through art and stories.

However, in line with the spirit of our project, membership in *The DangleBat Chronicles* does not come with exclusive perks or benefits. Our stories and illustrations are freely available to all, and we believe that the true value of membership lies in the knowledge that you are making a real difference in the lives of artists in need, and contributing to a project that aims to make the world a better, more understanding place.

Donating to *The DangleBat Chronicles* is more than just a financial transaction â€“ it is an affirmation of your belief in the transformative power of art, stories, and shared human experiences.
